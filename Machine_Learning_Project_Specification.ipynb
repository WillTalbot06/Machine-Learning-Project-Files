    "# Project: Constructing and applying Machine Learning models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "Machine Learning is the use and development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyse and draw inferences from patterns in data. In machine learning we are interested in creating functions or models which fit real data. Such functions can be found by making them dependent on a number of parameters which are updated over and over again to improve the fit to the data. You will explore in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suggested reading\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many great articles, books, videos about machine learning. This list just picks out a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Linear Regression Model](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuiltin.com%2Fdata-science%2Fregression-machine-learning&data=05%7C02%7Cr.m.lissaman%40warwick.ac.uk%7Cd1a1c7aea6f24f64013008dc11660633%7C09bacfbd47ef446592653546f2eaf6bc%7C0%7C0%7C638404377086620510%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=qRO9I25r9ACsSVXLa0vJXZNj%2BTK4Ha2iW7HzGoEKYlc%3D&reserved=0). Short, simple article covering a task similar to A2 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Logistic Regression Model](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/) An article which covers models similar to those in A3 and A4 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "[What is a neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk). Great YouTube series of introductory videos about training neural networks by the excellent 3Blue1Brown, well worth watching.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Blog: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/). Good discussion of the basic ideas used in this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Hands on Machine Learning with Python](https://0-link-springer-com.pugwash.lib.warwick.ac.uk/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-7921-2) This might accompany a full course on machine learning. It has much more detail that you will need. As the title says, it's all done using Python. It's well-written and popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Struture of project\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 tasks in the document below, tasks A1-A4 in Section A and then tasks B1 and B2 in section B. Your group should do all the  tasks in section A and at least one of the two tasks in section B. A1-A4 are worth approximately 60% of the credit for this submission and section B is worth approximately the other 40%.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes on submission\n",
    "Read through the document **MA124 Maths by Computer Tutor Group Projects Information for Students.pdf** on the MA124 Moodle page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting see the notes at the end of this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Allowed libraries for this project:\n",
    "numpy matplotlib copy pandas scikitlearn. **Note you may not use scikitlearn in any of tasks A2, A3 or A4.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you may include these lines of code at the start of of your code cells (and please use the aliases given below)."

    "In a recent research article published in the journal Computer Communications, authors Sathishkumar V E, Jangwoo Park, and Yongyun Cho sought to predict the \"bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes\"[1]. They employed several regression models, including linear regression. The dataset used in the original study is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand).\n",

    "The original research article and a modified dataset are posted on the MA124 Moodle page in the resources for this project. You will need to refer to the article for some of the tasks below. You will need to download SeoulBikeData_mod.csv and put it into the folder with this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "SeoulBikeData_mod.csv has been modified from the original dataset to remove the categorical variables, and to convert dates to months. Months have been coded by number, e.g. 1 = January, etc. Only half the months are included in the modified dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Import needed libraries. (You will need pandas, as well as things from sklearn, and of course numpy and matplotlib.)\n",

    "2. Using pandas, read SeoulBikeData_mod.csv into a Dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `describe` the Dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Plot a histogram of `Rented Bike Count`. Do not plot this as a density, but as a count. See Fig. 3 of the article. The vertical axis in the article is labelled \"frequency\", but is the same as the count.\n",

    "6. Perform a test-train split to create `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train` and `y_test`. You **must** use the same percentage of data for testing and training as was used in the article and you **must** state what they are. You can find these in the article.\n",

    "8. Use the trained model to obtain `y_pred`, the prediction on the test data `X_test`. Form the residual `resid = y_test - y_pred`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Compute and report: Rsquared (R2), the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Variation (CV). Compare these results to those on the top, right of Table 4 of the article. (Note, the modified dataset we are studying is different from that used in the article.

    "- Histograms of `y_test` and of `y_pred` (on the same plot). These should be reported as counts rather than densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A scatter plot of `resid` as a function of `y_test` corresponding to Fig. 9 of the article. (Recall what `y_test` represents and label the plot appropriately.) Unlike Fig. 9 of the paper, you should use a colormap to plot the different `Hours` in different colours.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A scatter plot of `resid` as a function of `X_test['Month']`. Use a colormap to indicate the absolute value of `resid`.\n",

    "### Task A2 Linear Regression, on a very small dataset, from scratch with only numpy (worth approximately 10% of the marks)\n",
    "#### (illustrating idea of rates of change with respect to the model parameters and gradient descent)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a really small dataset consisting of only three points in the plane: $(1,1),(2,4),(3,5)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each point (training example) consider the $x$-coordinate as a single input feature, and the $y$-coordinate as the output or label of the example. The objective is to find the best line to fit these data. Here 'best' will mean the line which minimises the mean of the sum of the squares of the residuals with respect to the three points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task and in the following tasks A3 and A4 we will use a slightly different convention to store our data with respect to the one used in A1 or the lectures. $X_{\\text{train}}$ and $y_{\\text{train}}$ will now be the transpose of the corresponding matrices in A1. In A3 and A4 this will be a more convenient form for applying functions given by matrices to the data with the matrix on the left of the data matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature matrix $X_{\\text{train}}$ contains the feature vectors for all the training examples. More precisely $X_{\\text{train}}= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} $ has one column for each training example and each column is the feature vector for that training example (in this case we have only one feature which is the $x$-coordinate).\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels matrix $y_{\\text{train}}$ contains the labels for all the training examples. More precisely $y_{\\text{train}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 4 & 5\\end{pmatrix}$ has one column for each training example and each column contains the label for that training example (the $y$-coordinate).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model here is a simple linear model\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat y = mx +c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with trainable parameters $m$ and $c$. The goal is to find the optimal values of $m$ and $c$ to fit these training data. In the Machine Learning context this means defining a loss function between prediction and true label:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(\\hat y, y)=(\\hat y - y)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and a cost function which is simply the average on all training examples of these losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specifically, you should**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show, in a markdown cell, how the cost $J$ depends only on the trainable parameters $m$ and $c$, and can be computed to be:\n",
    "$$ J=\\displaystyle\\frac{14m^2+12cm-48m+3c^2-20c+42}{3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find, in a markdown cell, expressions for the partial derivatives $\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial m}$ and $\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial c}$.\n",
    "3. Write a function `model1(alpha, num_iterations)` which takes as inputs a  learning rate `alpha` and a number of iterations `num_iterations`, and returns optimized values of $m$ and $c$ through Gradient Descent. More precisely the function should initialize $m$ and $c$ randomly between $-2$ and $2$ and then perform `num_iterations` steps of gradient descent with learning rate `alpha`. This means that the value of $m$ is updated to $m - \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial m}\\alpha$ and the value of $c$ is updated to $c - \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial c}\\alpha$ in each iteration.\n",
    "Your function should print the cost $J$ periodically throughout the iteration process. You may wish to refer to the Machine learning project lecture for help with this. You may wish to build helper functions for the various tasks you need this function to do and refer to them.\n",
    "4. Plot the 3 datapoints along with the optimal line $mx+c$ your model has found.\n",
    "5. Explore the effect of changing the learning rate and the number of iterations.\n",
